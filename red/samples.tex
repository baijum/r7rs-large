the bits of sample implementations that appear in the respective
SRFIs. Presumably this will be useful to those preparing the final
repositories of SRFI code.

T.B.D.

\section{SRFI 133}



The sample implementation is in the repository of this SRFI. It has only
one non-R5RS dependency: \protect\hyperlink{SRFI-23}{SRFI 23}'s
\texttt{error} procedure, which is also provided by R7RS-small. It is in
the public domain, or alternatively under the same copyright as this
SRFI. The following files are provided:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{vectors-impl.scm} - a modified version of the implementation
  of SRFI 43
\item
  \texttt{vectors.scm} - a Chicken library showing what to export for an
  R5RS implementation
\item
  \texttt{vectors.sld} - an R7RS library that excludes what R7RS-small
  already provides
\item
  \texttt{vectors-test.scm} - tests using the Chicken test egg (also
  available on Chibi)
\end{itemize}

\section{SRFI 132}
\section{Implementation}\label{implementation}

The sample implementation is a modified version of the Scheme 48
implementation of the \texttt{sorting} structure, and is found in the
repository of this SRFI. It will use the R6RS sorting library if it is
available, but does not depend on it. This is close to the original SRFI
32 reference implementation, but includes some bug fixes and switches
the \textless{} and = arguments to the initial position. It also adds
implementations for the median and selection procedures. The code is
very portable and freely reusable. It is tightly bummed, as far as could
be done in portable Scheme, and is commented in Olin's usual voluminous
style, including notes on porting and implementation-specific
optimizations. The median and selection code is specific to this SRFI.

The only non-R4RS features in the code are the use of R5RS/R6RS/R7RS
multiple-value return, with \texttt{values} and
\texttt{call-with-values} procedures, and the use of R7RS-style
\texttt{error} to report an assertion violation.

You could speed up the vector code a lot by error-checking the procedure
parameters and then shifting over to fixnum-specific arithmetic and
dangerous vector-indexing and vector-setting primitives. The comments in
the code indicate where the initial error checks would have to be added.
There are several \texttt{(quotient\ }\emph{n}\texttt{\ 2)} calls that
could be changed to a fixnum right-shift, as well, in both the list and
vector code. The code is designed to enable this --- each file usually
exports one or two ``safe'' procedures that end up calling an internal
``dangerous'' primitive. The little exported cover procedures are where
you move the error checks.

This should provide \emph{big} speedups. In fact, all the code bumming
in the source pretty much disappears in the noise unless you have a good
compiler and also can dump the vector-index checks and generic
arithmetic --- so it's really set up for optimization rather than fully
optimized.

The optional-arg parsing, defaulting, and error checking is done with a
portable \texttt{syntax-rules} macro. But if the target Scheme has a
faster mechanism (e.g., Chez), it's definitely better to switch to using
it. Note that argument defaulting and error-checking are interleaved ---
there's no need to error-check defaulted \emph{start} and \emph{end}
args to see if they are fixnums that are legal vector indices for the
corresponding vector, etc.

\subsection{Sample implementation
copyright}\label{Sampleimplementationcopyright}

Short summary: no restrictions.

While Olin wrote all of this code himself, he read a lot of code before
he began writing. However, all such code is, itself, either open source
or public domain, rendering irrelevant any issue of ``copyright taint.''

Hence the sample implementation is Copyright Â© 1998 by Olin Shivers and
made available under the same copyright as the SRFI text (see above).

\section{Sets and Bags}
\section{Implementation}\label{implementation}

The implementation places the identifiers defined above into the
\texttt{sets} library.

Sets and bags are implemented as a thin veneer over hashtables.

The implementation registers \texttt{set-comparator} and
\texttt{bag-comparator} with SRFI 114's default comparator, assuming the
sample implementation of SRFI 114 is being used. Scheme implementers who
provide their own implementations of SRFI 114 must change this part of
the code.

The \href{http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-113/sets.tar.gz}{sample
implementation} contains the following files:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{sets-impl.scm} -- implementation of general sets and bags
\item
  \texttt{sets.sld} -- an R7RS library named \texttt{(sets)}
\item
  \texttt{sets.scm} -- a Chicken library
\item
  \texttt{sets-test.scm} -- test suite
\end{itemize}

The test suite will work with the Chicken \texttt{test} egg, which is
provided on Chibi as the \texttt{(chibi\ test)} library.

\section{Character sets}

This SRFI comes with a reference implementation. It resides at:

\url{http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-14/srfi-14.scm}

I have placed this source on the Net with an unencumbered, ``open''
copyright. Some of the code in the reference implementation bears a
distant family relation to the MIT Scheme implementation, and being
derived from that code, is covered by the MIT Scheme copyright (which is
a generic BSD-style open-source copyright -- see the source file for
details). The remainder of the code was written by myself for scsh or
for this SRFI; I have placed this code under the scsh copyright, which
is also a generic BSD-style open-source copyright.

The code is written for portability and should be simple to port to any
Scheme. It has only the following deviations from R4RS, clearly
discussed in the comments:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  an \texttt{error} procedure;
\item
  the R5RS \texttt{values} procedure for producing multiple return
  values;
\item
  a simple \texttt{check-arg} procedure for argument checking;
\item
  \texttt{let-optionals*} and \texttt{:optional} macros for for parsing,
  checking and defaulting optional arguments from rest lists;
\item
  The SRFI-19 \texttt{define-record-type} form;
\item
  \texttt{bitwise-and} for the hash function;
\item
  \texttt{\%latin1}{???}{char} and
  \texttt{\%char}{???}{latin1}.
\end{itemize}

The library is written for clarity and well-commented; the current
source is about 375 lines of source code and 375 lines of comments and
white space. It is also written for efficiency. Fast paths are provided
for common cases.

This is not to say that the implementation can't be tuned up for a
specific Scheme implementation. There are notes in comments addressing
ways implementors can tune the reference implementation for performance.

In short, I've written the reference implementation to make it as
painless as possible for an implementor -- or a regular programmer -- to
adopt this library and get good results with it.

The code uses a rather simple-minded, inefficient representation for
ASCII/Latin-1 char-sets -- a 256-character string. The character whose
code is i is in the set if s{[}i{]} = ASCII 1 (soh, or \^{}a); not in
the set if s{[}i{]} = ASCII 0 (nul). A much faster and denser
representation would be 16 or 32 bytes worth of bit string. A portable
implementation using bit sets awaits standards for bitwise logical-ops
and byte vectors.

``Large'' character types, such as Unicode, should use a sparse
representation, taking care that the Latin-1 subset continues to be
represented with a dense 32-byte bit set.

\section{Hash tables}

\section{Implementation}\label{implementation}

The current sample implementation is in the code repository of this
SRFI. It relies upon
\href{http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-126/srfi-126.html}{SRFI 126} and
\href{http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-128/srfi-128.html}{SRFI 128}, but
the sample implementation for SRFI 126 is easily layered over any hash
table implementation that supports either SRFI 69 or R6RS.

The sample implementation of this SRFI never calls any hash function
with two arguments.

The original intention was to make it possible to implement this SRFI on
top of all the native hash table systems mentioned in
\href{http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-125/srfi-125.html\#Sources}{Sources}
above as well. However, this turned out not to be practical for the
following reasons:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Gauche does not support arbitrary equality predicates, only
  \texttt{eq?}, \texttt{eqv?}, \texttt{equal?}, and \texttt{string=?}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  S7 does not support arbitrary equality predicates: the implementation
  chooses a predicate based on the nature of the keys.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  SISC, Scheme48/scsh, RScheme, Scheme 9, and Rep do not document any
  way of inspecting a hash table to determine its equality predicates
  and hash functions so that it can be re-created.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  SLIB hash tables are vectors, not disjoint objects.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  FemtoLisp supports only \texttt{equal?} as the equality predicate.
\end{itemize}

Native Guile hash tables are a special case. The equivalents of
\texttt{hash-table-ref/default}, \texttt{hash-table-set!}, and
\texttt{hash-table-delete} require the equality predicate and hash
function to be passed to them explicitly (although there are utility
functions for \texttt{eq?}, \texttt{eqv?}, and \texttt{equal?} hash
tables). Consequently, hash tables corresponding to this SRFI would have
to be records containing a Guile hash table, an equality predicate, and
a hash function, which means they could not interoperate directly with
native Guile hash tables.

\section{SRFI 116}

The sample implementation of this SRFI is derived from the sample
implementation of SRFI 1. It depends on SRFI 9 (or R7RS) records. The
five files in the implementation are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{ilists-impl.scm} is a modified version of the SRFI 1
  implementation.
\item
  \texttt{ilists-base.scm} provides the definition of ipair records as
  well as additional procedures that are required by this SRFI.
\item
  \texttt{ilists.sld} is an R7RS library.
\item
  \texttt{ilists.scm} is a Chicken library.
\item
  \texttt{ilists-test.scm} is a set of tests using the Chicken
  \texttt{test} egg, which is also available in Chibi as the R7RS
  library \texttt{(chibi\ test)}.
\end{itemize}

\section{SRFI 101}

A portable R6RS library \href{srfi-101.sls}{reference implementation}
and \href{srfi-101-tests.sls}{test suite} are provided. The library has
been tested successfully using Ikarus (0.0.3), Larceny (0.97), and PLT
Scheme (4.2.1.7).

A PLT Scheme specific library that implements purely functional
random-access lists, but with an API designed to be consistent with
PLT's list libraries rather than R6RS, is available as the RaList
package on Planet {[}\protect\hyperlink{note-5}{5}{]}.
 
\section{SRFI 134}

The sample implementation is in the in the \texttt{ideque-2list}
subdirectory of the repository for this SRFI. It is an implementation
based on two Scheme lists, one for the front and another (in reverse
element order) for the back. The cost of \texttt{ideque-front},
\texttt{ideque-back}, \texttt{ideque-remove-front}, and
\texttt{ideque-remove-back} are amortized O(1). An implementation based
on finger trees may be added later.

\section{SRFI 135}

This SRFI comes with sample implementations organized as a
representation-independent library that imports one of three kernel
libraries:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{kernel16} uses an internal representation based on UTF-16,
  which performs well when strings can represent any Unicode text and
  non-ASCII characters are common.
\item
  \texttt{kernel8} uses an internal representation based on UTF-8, which
  performs well when strings can represent any Unicode text but most
  texts consist of ASCII characters.
\item
  \texttt{kernel0} uses an internal representation based on Scheme
  strings, which performs well if strings are acceptably space-efficient
  and the \texttt{string-ref} procedure runs in constant time. It also
  performs well in interpreted systems even when \texttt{string-ref}
  takes linear time, because the built-in \texttt{string-ref} is likely
  to run faster on short strings than any UTF-8 or UTF-16 scanner that
  could be written in Scheme.
\end{itemize}

All three kernels implement a \texttt{text-ref} procedure that runs in
O(1) time. All three kernels use shared substructures to improve both
space efficiency and running time.

The sample implementations come with a black-box test program derived
from a black-box test program written for SRFI 130.

There is also a program that compares the performance of strings and
texts on a number of micro-benchmarks. These benchmarks are hardly
typical, but they provide a rational basis for discussing performance
tradeoffs between immutable texts, mutable strings with SRFI 130 cursors
and operations, and the standard R7RS operations on strings.

\section{SRFI 121}

\section{Implementation}\label{implementation}

The sample implementation is in the SRFI 121 repository. It contains the
following files:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{generators-impl.scm} - implementation of generators
\item
  \texttt{r7rs-shim.scm} - supplementary code for non-R7RS systems
\item
  \texttt{generators.sld} - R7RS library
\item
  \texttt{generators.scm} - Chicken library
\item
  \texttt{generators-test.scm} - Chicken test-egg test file
\end{itemize}

\section{SRFI 127}

\section{{Sample Implementation}}\label{sample-implementation}

The files in the implementation are in the SRFI 127 repository, and are
as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{lseq.sld} - an R7RS library
\item
  \texttt{lseq.scm} - a Chicken library
\item
  \texttt{lseq-impl.scm} - portable implementation code
\item
  \texttt{lseq-test.scm} - a Chicken test-egg file
\end{itemize}

\section{SRFI 41}
Bird and Wadler describe streams as either null or a pair with a stream
in the tail:

Î± list :: null \textbar{} Î± * Î± list

That works in a purely functional language such as Miranda or Haskell
because the entire language is lazy. In an eager language like ML or
Scheme, of course, it's just a normal, eager list.

Using ML, Wadler, Taha and MacQueen give the type of even streams as:

\begin{verbatim}
datatype 'a stream_
  = Nil_
  | Cons_ of 'a * 'a stream
withtype 'a stream
  = 'a stream_ susp;
\end{verbatim}

Their susp type is similar to Scheme's promise type. Since Scheme
conflates the notions of record and type (the only way to create a new
type disjoint from all other types is to create a record), it is
necessary to distribute the suspension through the two constructors of
the stream data type:

\begin{verbatim}
Î± stream
  :: (promise stream-null)
  |  (promise (Î± stream-pair))
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
Î± stream-pair
  :: Î± Ã (Î± stream)
\end{verbatim}

That type captures the systematic suspension of recursive promises that
is the essence of ``streamness.'' But it doesn't quite work, because
Scheme is eager rather than lazy, and both the car and the cdr of the
stream are evaluated too early. So the final type of streams delays both
the car and the cdr of the stream-pair:

\begin{verbatim}
Î± stream
  :: (promise stream-null)
  |  (promise (Î± stream-pair))
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
Î± stream-pair
  :: (promise Î±) Ã (promise (Î± stream))
\end{verbatim}

The two outer promises, in the stream type, provide streams without
memoization. The two inner promises, in the stream-pair type, add the
memoization that is characteristic of streams in modern functional
languages.

Lists provide seven primitive operations: the two constructors '() and
cons, the type predicates list?, null? and pair?, and the accessors car
and cdr for pairs. All other list operations can be derived from those
primitives.

It would seem that the same set of primitives could apply to streams,
but in fact one additional primitive is required. AndrÃ© van Tonder
describes the reason in his discussion of the promise data type. The
promises of R6RS are inadequate to support iterative algorithms because
each time a promise is called iteratively it binds the old promise in
the closure that defines the new promise (so the old promise can be
forced later, if requested). However, in the case of iteration, the old
promise becomes unreachable, so instead of creating a new promise that
binds the old promise within, it is better to mutate the promise; that
way, no space is wasted by the old promise.

Van Tonder describes this new promise type, and provides a recipe for
its use: all constructors are wrapped with delay, all accessors are
wrapped with force, and all function bodies are wrapped with lazy. Given
the seven primitives above, the first two parts of van Tonder's recipe
are simple: the two constructors stream-null and stream-pair hide delay,
and the two accessors stream-car and stream-cdr hide force (stream-null?
and stream-pair? also hide force, so they can distinguish the two
constructors of the stream type).

Although the new promise type prevents a space leak, it creates a new
problem: there is no place to hide the lazy that is the third part of
van Tonder's recipe. SRFI-40 solved this problem by exposing it
(actually, it exposed delay, which was incorrect). But that violates
good software engineering by preventing the stream data type from being
fully abstract. The solution of SRFI-41 is to create a new primitive,
stream-lambda, that returns a function that hides lazy.

Besides hiding lazy and making the types work out correctly,
stream-lambda is obvious and easy-to-use for competent Scheme
programmers, especially when augmented with the syntactic sugar of
define-stream and named stream-let. The alternative of exposing
stream-lazy would be less clear and harder to use.

One of the hardest tasks when writing any program library is to decide
what to include and, more importantly, what to exclude. One important
guideline is minimalism, since once an operator enters a library it must
remain forever: \emph{Il semble que la perfection soit atteinte non
quand il n'y a plus rien Ã  ajouter, mais quand il n'y a plus rien Ã 
retrancher}.

Since streams are substantially slower than lists (the stream primitives
require numerous type conversions, and list operations in most Scheme
implementations are heavily optimized), most programmers will use
streams only when the sequence of elements is truly infinite (such as
mathematical series) or when there is some clear advantage of laziness
(such as reducing the number of passes though a large data set). Thus,
the library is biased toward functions that work with infinite streams
left-to-right. In particular, there is no right-fold; if you need to
materialize an entire stream, it's best to use a list.

\section{SRFI 111: boxes}

Here is a definition as an R7RS library:

\begin{verbatim}
(define-library (srfi 111)
  (import (scheme base))
  (export box box? unbox set-box!)
  
  (begin
    (define-record-type box-type
      (box value)
      box?
      (value unbox set-box!))))
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{define-record-type} macro will also work on R5RS Schemes
that provide SRFI 9.

Here is a translation into R6RS Scheme:

\begin{verbatim}
(library (srfi :111)
  (export box box? unbox set-box!)
  (import (rnrs base) (rnrs records syntactic))
  
  (define-record-type
    (box-type box box?)
    (fields
      (mutable value unbox set-box!))))
\end{verbatim}

Finally, here is an implementation in pure R5RS (plus \texttt{error})
that depends on redefining \texttt{pair?}.

\begin{verbatim}
;; Prepare to redefine pair?.
(define %true-pair? pair?)

;; Unique object in the cdr of a pair flags it as a box.
(define %box-flag (string-copy "box flag"))

;; Predicate
(define (box? x) (and (%true-pair? x) (eq? (cdr x) %box-flag)))

;; Constructor
(define (box x) (cons x %box-flag))

;; Accessor
(define (unbox x)
  (if (box? x)
    (car x)
    (error "Attempt to unbox non-box")))
    
;; Mutator
(define (set-box! x y)
  (if (box? x)
    (set-car! x y)
    (error "Attempt to mutate non-box")))

;; Override pair?.
(set! pair?
  (lambda (x)
    (and (%true-pair? x) (not (box? x)))))
\end{verbatim}

Note that these implementations do not support the lexical syntax.

\section{SRFI 117: List queues}

The sample implementation places the identifiers defined above into the
\texttt{list-queue} library.

The \href{http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-117/list-queues.tar.gz}{sample
implementation} contains the following files:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{list-queues-impl.scm} -- implementation of queues
\item
  \texttt{list-queues.sld} -- an R7RS library named
  \texttt{(list-queue)}
\item
  \texttt{list-queues.scm} -- a Chicken library
\item
  \texttt{list-queues-test.scm} -- tests using the Chicken test egg
\end{itemize}

\section{SRFI 124: Ephemerons}

Ephemerons are currently available in
\href{http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/documentation/mit-scheme-ref/Ephemerons.html}{MIT
Scheme}, in
\href{http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/ephemerons.html}{Racket},
and in Chibi, though current versions of Chibi have a bug; the Chibi GC
will not break an ephemeron properly if its datum refers to its key. The
MIT version allows ephemeron keys and datums to be mutated using
\texttt{set-ephemeron-key!} and \texttt{set-ephemeron-datum!}, but this
SRFI does not require this capacity, as it is tricky to implement on
systems where the GC runs in a separate thread. The effect of mutable
ephemerons can be achieved using immutable ephemerons that hold
\href{http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-111/srfi-111.html}{SRFI 111} mutable
boxes, provided care is taken to always point to the box and not to its
contents.

The implementation in \texttt{ephemerons-trivial.scm} does not have any
hooks to the GC, but it is still a correct implementation, because there
are no guarantees that the GC will ever break any ephemerons, or run at
all, or even exist. (Thanks to Will Clinger for this insight.) It is
portable to any R7RS-small or R5RS + SRFI 9 system.

The implementation in \texttt{ephemerons-racket.scm} layers this SRFI's
semantics on top of Racket's native ephemerons. The idea here is that
the native-level ephemeron value is a pair containing the key and the
datum, so that the key can be reliably retrieved and a broken ephemeron
can be distinguished from one whose key or value is \texttt{\#f}.
Reference barriers are not supported.

The files \texttt{ephemeron-hash.scm} and \texttt{ephemeron-tree.scm}
are by Taylor Campbell, and constitute a demonstration written in
pseudo-Scheme of how ephemerons can be implemented in full. He has
offered to provide assistance in transforming them into Pre-Scheme for
Scheme48.

Ephemerons with built-in finalizers are also available in GHC's
implementation of Haskell under the name of
\href{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.8.1.0/docs/System-Mem-Weak.html}{weak
pointers}.

\section{SRFI 128: Comparators}
The \href{comparators.tar.gz}{sample implementation} is found in the
repository of this SRFI. It contains the following files.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{comparators-impl.scm} - the record type definition and most of
  the procedures
\item
  \texttt{default.scm} - a simple implementation of the default
  constructor, which should be improved by implementers to handle
  records and implementation-specific types
\item
  \texttt{r7rs-shim.scm} - procedures for R7RS compatibility, including
  a trivial implementation of bytevectors on top of
  \href{http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-4/srfi-4.html}{SRFI 4} u8vectors
\item
  \texttt{complex-shim.scm} - a trivial implementation of
  \texttt{real-part} and \texttt{imag-part} for Schemes that don't have
  complex numbers
\item
  \texttt{comparators.meta} - Chicken-specific metadata
\item
  \texttt{comparators.setup} - Chicken-specific executable setup
\item
  \texttt{comparators.sld} - an R7RS library
\item
  \texttt{comparators.scm} - a Chicken library
\item
  \texttt{comparators-test.scm} - a test file using the Chicken
  \texttt{test} egg
\end{itemize}
